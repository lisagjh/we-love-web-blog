                <p class="summary">Simon is a freelance developer and designer, who works with computational design. He
                    told us about creative coding, tools, and showed us some of his cases.<br> <br>
                    One of my biggest take aways from his talk was to keep interactions lightweight, and to just make
                    cool stuff.</p>

                <p>Justus has a new passion: the indie web! I loved this talk because before i started at FDND I learned
                    some basic HTML and CSS on the indieweb.<br><br>
                    Justus told us about how he loved the web, but how it's changed from when he started using it. He
                    showed us some cool stuff he used to work with, stuff that he misses in today's web. Like how the
                    web is much less personal than ever. and how to fix that! <br><br>
                    Digital Gardens. The solution! It's simple: create your own corner on the web. It doesn't have to be
                    finished when you publish it, it just has to be yours. </p>

                <h3>Sanne Swagerman - Spotify</h3>
                <h4>24.05.2024</h4>
                <p>Sanne gave a talk about the differences between study and work. She told us about her career, and how
                    she went from a bachelor in communication and multimedia design, to landing her dream job. <br><br>
                    Sanne told us about the difference between agencies and big tech corporations, how their interview
                    process is different and how you can prepare for one. She also spoke about how you can figure out
                    what you actually want; what is important to you, do you prefer a big or small company, do you want
                    to work remote? <br><br>
                    My biggest take away from this talk was that <span class="impostor">impostor syndrome</span> is
                    normal. Everyone will experience
                    this at some point in their career. You don't have to be afraid to ask for help, no matter where you
                    are in your career.</p>
